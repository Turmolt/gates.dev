   "I developed a Mixed Reality Tennis application showcased at the 2019 US Open. This multiplayer application featured multiple participants competing with dynamic visual effects."
   [:br] [:br]"The setup included two stations with VR tracking pucks attached to tennis rackets, a tablet, and a large LED wall displaying the game state with prominent visual effects. Communication between devices was handled by a custom TCP Client/Server plugin I developed."
   [:br] [:br] "I was responsible for all aspects of the project except swing detection, including gameplay, networking, and visual effects. Using Houdini and Substance Designer, I created textures and flipbooks for the application."
   [:br] [:br] "I played a significant role in game design, handling all gameplay system design and implementation."
   [:br] [:br] "The top half of the screen shows the LED wall display, while the bottom half shows one of the playerâ€™s screens."])
